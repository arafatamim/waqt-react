# Waqt React

Version of my web app [Waqt](https://github.com/arafatamim/waqt-web) rewritten in React. This is purely for learning purposes.

## Test it out

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
